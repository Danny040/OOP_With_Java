# Java OOP Practice Projects
A pair of small Java applications built to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These projects were developed as part of my academic learning and personal practice.

# Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe (Java Console Version)
* Turn-based 2-player mode
* Console interface with clear grid updates
* Input validation to prevent overwriting moves
* Modular structure using Player, Board, and Game classes

## OOP Concepts Used:
Class structure, encapsulation, object interaction

# Project 2: Contact List Manager
* Add, remove, and display contacts
* Each contact contains name, email, and phone number
* Console menu for user interaction
* Stored in memory (no database or file I/O)

## OOP Concepts Used:
* Contact class with private fields and accessors
* Separation of concerns (UI logic vs data model)
* Dynamic list management using Java collections

---

# Learning Focus
* Applying Java syntax and design structure
* Working with classes, objects, arrays/lists
* Structuring logic across multiple files
* Practicing input/output via terminal
